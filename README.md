## Privacy
I do not save any email addresses you input into this app for any purpose other than immediate issues that arrive with the service. I will not email any emails you use in this app. If you need to contact me, I've added a contact form on the contact page. 

The Resend API only temporarily saved the email addresses it received in order to provide support for bugs and issues.

# Request
There will be two main outputs from this process:
- a design concept
- a design system

# Design Concept
A design concept is a high-level description of the design of an application. It is a collection of design principles that are used to create a design system. This is a document typically created by a creative director or designer. It is a document that is used to guide the creation of a design system.

## Analyze design
Deeply analyze the design of the current application to create a 'docs/design_concept.json' file in this project that describes the style and design of every UI compenement needed in a design system at a high level, like a creative director.

Capture high-level guidelines for:
- structure
- spacing
- fonts
- colors
- design style
- design principles

The goal with this file is to instruct AI to be able to replicate this look easily in this project.

## Output
Output your design concept into a file called 'docs/design_concept.json'.

## Design System
Use the design concept to guide the creation of the design system.

# Design a Design System
We are creating a DESIGN SYSTEM from the design found in this application. This application does not have all the components found in a design system. We need to create a design system that inclkudes many common components found in the applications. This is a creative process and needs to be done thoughtfully and creatively -- always staying true to the design concepts and principles found in this current design.

## Intention
We want to outline the exact styling for all components and styles in this app, along with high level design guidelines, as there may be future components created and it should be clear to the building agent how to create new styles for it.

# Output
Output your design system into a file called 'docs/design-system.json'.

Create a tool tip that appears when the user hovers over a sendButton that is greyed out that says "There's some missing info. Make sure you've selected a dog and filled out the name and email fields. Once the form is filled out correctly, this button will be clickable."

On both the BoopForm and the contact page, append the labels of all required fields with an '*' that is this color: #f87171.

On all pages, including the homepage, add a thin menu bar at the top with the about and contact links.

On the about page, in the "Who am I?" section, Add this photo above the text: assets/images/general/bio-pic.jpeg. Style it with rounded corners the same radius as the dog pics.

On the BoopPreview page, add this image below the words : Appreciate this app? Leave a tip at Ko-fi! and add a link to the button that also goes to 'https://ko-fi.com/alannarisse'. Keep the link in the text as well.



## Completed 2/6

Use the attached screenshot as the basis for a UI redesign.
Redesign the application's **visual style, layout, spacing, and component expression** to match the **theme and design language** shown in the image. The heart icon on the image will replace the checkmark in the current design and can be animated when clicked. 

**Important constraints**
* Presenve the application's **existing structure, hierarchy, and functionality** - how the app works should remain the same. 

* Focus on **UI and interaction design**, not new features or workflows.

* Any imagery, illustrations, photos, or complex visual assets in the screenshot may be ** approximated, simplified, or ignored** if source assets are unavailable.

The goal is to re-theme the application as closely as possible to the provided design **using realistic, buildable UI components**, while maintaining usability and clarity.

## To Do Features and Fixes

## Add a top navigation to the app which includes: 
* The logo which links to the home page should be on the left side of the nav
* An "About" link that takes them to an about page on the right side of the nav
* A "Contact" link that takes them to an Contact page on the right side of the nav



## Add Contact page
Add a contact page that has a form incuding the fields: Name, email, and comments (large textarea allowing 500 characters) and the buttons: 'cancel' and 'send'
Cancel returns them to the homepage.
Hitting send repaces the form with a message saying the message was sent successfully.
There should be a header at the top of the page that says "Contact Me About Send a Boop"

## Add About page

What is Send a Boop
This project was originally imagined while teaching a UX/UI class at Portland State. It was a demo project for an assignment using Figma to design an app concept. I liked the idea so much that I wanted to make it real. The Internet kinda sucks now. Everyone wants something from you. I just want to brighten people’s day with an app that, for once, doesn’t want anything in return.

Who Am I?
Hi there! I’m Alanna Risse. I live in Portland, Oregon. I teach part-time in Portland State’s Graphic Design program. I’ve been a web developer since 1997.

Send A Boop’s Privacy Policy
I am not collecting your email addresses for anything other than making sure my service still works. The email service I use, Resend, stores my customers’ data (you and/or your friend’s email) for a short period of time to make sure the service is working correctly.

I will never use your email for anything other than letting you send boops to your friends. You won’t get any emails from me. No I am not an evil internet overlord pretending to offer you a free service and then taking your email for nefarious purposes. I’m just a gal who wishes there were more free, fun things on the internet just for the sake of being fun.

## Add random page
Let's allow for a user to click a button labelled "choose for me" and the app will choose a random dog for them. There should be some feedback, i think it could exist in a small div above the grid of images that shows the selected dog and asks does this work? If they choose the "yes" button, it will scroll the user down to the bottom of the page where they can fill out the form. Or they can shoose "choose again" and it will replace the chosen dog with a new random dog.
